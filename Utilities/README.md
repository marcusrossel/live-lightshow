# Utilities

This directory contains _bash_-scripts meant for sourcing in other scripts. Each one provides constants and functions for specific domains:

**`scripting.sh`** provides general purpose functions for scanning and manipulating strings and files, as well as handeling user-facing inputs and outputs.

**`lookup.sh`** serves as an interface for accessing the content in the project's _Lookup Files_ folder.

**`index.sh`** provides functions for conveniently accessing the project's index files (in _Configuration > Index_).

**`types.sh`** contains functions to be used when dealing with trait value types.

**`testing.sh`** contains functions meant to provide a uniform output when writing tests.
