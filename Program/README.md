# Program

This directory contains the _Processing_-programs executed to run the light show.

**`Lightshow`** contains the program files required for capturing audio input, creating the _Arduino_ and configuration objects, instantiating the servers, and continuously providing the servers with new audio chunks.

**`Servers`** contains the servers' program files, either supplied by this project or imported by the user.

**`StandardFirmata`** is a directory created upon installation. It contains the `StandardFirmata.ino` program which is pushed to the _Arduino_.
