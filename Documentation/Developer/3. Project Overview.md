# Project Overview

This document contains a high-level overview of all of the components contained in the _Live Lightshow_ project and explains how they work and interconnect.

![Project Structure](../Assets/Project%20Structure.png)

The project can roughly be split into three parts, responsible for different tasks:

1. **Proper Program:**
This part encompasses the files which contribute to running the actual program (started by `lightshow start`). It is limited to the _Program_ directory and is written in the _Processing_ language.

2. **User and Cataloguing Scripts:**
This part is responsible for almost all of the user-facing features of the project. It is mostly limited to the _Catalogue_ and _Command Line Interface_ directories, with support from the _Utilities_ and _Lookup Files_ directories. This part is written in _Bash_.

3. **Supporting Files:**
This part consists of components required for enabling ease of use of the project. It is comprised of the _Installation_, _Tests_ and _Documentation_ directories.

## Proper Program

The proper program is split into three folders:

1. **_StandardFirmata:_**
This folder contains the program which will be loaded onto the _Arduino_ to allow serial communication with it. The program is downloaded and the folder created upon installation, and is therefore not present in the repository during development. The program is pushed onto the _Arduino_ whenever `lightshow initialize` is called.

2. **_Lightshow:_**
This folder contains the main components of the _Processing_-sketch which will be compiled and run upon `lightshow start`. `Lightshow.pde` is run first when the program starts. If is responsible for setting up a connection to the _Arduino_, creating configuration objects, instantiating servers, and capturing and feeding audio to the instances continuously. `Configuration.pde` defines the `Configuration` class, which is used by servers for accessing external configuration files. `Server.pde` defines the interface to which server-classes have to conform, in order to be usable with _Live Lightshow_.

3. **_Servers:_**
This folders contains the definitions (classes) of the servers, which can be used for a light show. During `lightshow start`, these files are temporarily copied to the _Lightshow_-folder to tie them into the compilation. This is the reason why all types declared in server files have to have unique names - or else compilation will fail.

## User and Cataloguing Scripts

### _Lookup Files:_

To make scripting for this project as transparent and modular as possible, constant values used throughout the project are seperated out into _lookup files_. These files contain the constants in a structured format, so that it is discernable which purpose a constant serves. These constants can be read from the files as is, but are easier to access by using the `lookup.sh` utility script. The purpose of each lookup file is described in the directory's [readme](../../Lookup%20Files/README.md).


### _Utilities:_

The _Utilities_ directory contains the _Bash_-equivalent of libraries - scripts that contain functions which can be imported in other scripts. Each library contains functions centered around a specific problem domain. So for example the scripts in the _Tests_ directory use the `testing.sh`-library, and the scipts concered with parsing use the `parsing.sh`-library. The purpose of each library is described in the directory's [readme](../../Utilities/README.md).

### _Catalogue:_

The _Catalogue_ directory contains scripts for cataloguing as well as catalogue data, corresponding to the subdirectories _Scripts_ and _Data_. Each of these directories is split into three further subdirectories:

1. **_Static:_**
The static folders contain scripts/data focussed around the catalogue which is created upon calling `lightshow initialize`. This includes the creation of a static index which contains information about which servers there are, what class names they have, which file they are located in, and which static configuration file belongs to them. It also entails the generation of said configuration files.

2. **_Runtime:_**
The runtime folders contain scripts/data focussed around the configuration used while a light show is running. This includes the creation and modificatation of said configuration files as a result of users' actions.  
The runtime files are only relevant for the currently running light show. The runtime index contains the server instances' names, their server types, as well as the name of their runtime configuration files.

3. **_Racks:_**
These folders contain scripts/data focussed around user generated racks. Each rack has its own folder which contains a manifest describing its setup as well as the associated configuration files. The rack data directory then contains an index over all of the racks.  
The rack scripts currently provide the functionality of printing information for the catalogued racks as well as saving and loading them.

### _Command Line Interface:_

The _Command Line Interface_ directory contains scripts focussed around user-facing tasks. This for example includes things like starting and ending a light show, or showing its information about the running light show.
The main interface for accessing these scripts is the `lightshow` script, which is moved to a `$PATH`-directory upon installation. Most of the time it simply provides a wrapper for scripts found in the CLI-directory.

## Supporting Files

The supporting files consist of three folders:

1. **_Installation:_**
This directory contains the scripts run by the user to install _Live Lightshow_. It is split into a script responsible for downloading dependencies, and one that configures the dependencies and moves all of the files to their proper destinations.

2. **_Tests:_**
This directory contains tests for other _Bash_-scripts in this project. The tests use the `testing.sh`-library to achieve a homogeneous output.

3. **_Documentation:_**
This directory contains documentation for user and developers of this project. More information can be found in the directory's [readme](../README.md).
