# Preface

Before developing for or working on _Live Lightshow_ there is currently an important caveat to note.  

The version of _Live Lightshow_ as released with this documentation is written in _Bash_ and _Processing_. But due to reasons of scalability, runtime and planned features, a rewrite in _Python_ is currently in the works.  
The rewrite will be happening on the `python` branch. When complete, it will be merged into (effectively replacing) the `master` branch. The current `master` will then be moved onto the `alpha` branch.
