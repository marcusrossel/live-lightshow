# Setup Example

This guide presents an example of how to set up a light show from the hardware to the software level.

The goal will be to create a setup using the _default_ server, that comes with _Live Lightshow_. It should visualize whatever audio the computer is playing, using four LEDs wired to an _Arduino_. The LEDs should visualize low, mid-range, high and all frequencies respectively.

## Wiring the _Arduino_

Wiring the _Arduino_ will be pretty easy for this example setup. We'll just connect LEDs to the _Arduino_'s pins 5, 6, 9 and 10 - each with a 100Ω resistor:

## Capturing System Audio

As _Live Lightshow_ uses your computer's selected audio line-in as audio source, we will have to find some way to make the system audio output available as audio input. This works differently for each operating system.

**_macOS_**:
On _macOS_ you will need an external utility to reroute your system audio. A free utility for this is _Soundflower_. Check [Appendix B](B.%20Capturing%20System%20Audio%20on%20macOS.md) for a setup guide.

**_Windows_**:
_Windows_ has an inbuilt utility called _Virtual Audio Cable_. To find out how to set it up, check out this [quick guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/364369/how-to-record-your-pc’s-audio-with-virtual-audio-cable/).

**_Linux_**: Capturing system audio as input is easiest on _Linux_. Check this [StackExchange post](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/82297) for an explanation.

## Configuring a Light Show

Configuring a _Live Lightshow_ to display the expected behaviour will now be pretty easy.  
First initialize your _Arduino_ using `lightshow initialize`, if you haven't already. Also, make sure to select the audio input device that captures your computer's audio output, in the system settings.

Now you can start a new light show using `lightshow start`. We will require four different types of behaviour for our LEDs, so we will create four server instances:

```
lows: default
mids: default
highs: default
all: default
```

If we now play audio on our computer, the LEDs won't show any reaction yet. This is because the _default_ server's _Output Pins_ trait has an empty list as default value. So we will need to change the _Output Pins_ traits to have the values `[5]`, `[6]`, `[9]` and `[10]` respectively using `lightshow live configure`.

If we now play audio, the LEDs will light up - but they will all light up in the same way. To change the range of frequencies each LED corresponds to, we will need to change the _Lower Frequency Bound_ and _Upper Frequency Bound_ traits to appropriate values (cf. below).

The LEDs will now behave as expected, but they might not trigger in unison with the music. This will require fine-tuning of the instances' traits.  
We can use `lightshow server info default` to figure out how the _default_ server works, before we configure the traits.

Below is an example of a setup (without the `all` instance) configured against _Bonobo_'s album [Black Sands](https://open.spotify.com/album/5m1RkwKeU7MV0Ni6PH2lPy).

The setup can be viewed by running `lightshow live info`, which then looks as follows:

```
A light show is currently running with the following setup:

Instance 'lows' of server type 'default'
• Lower Frequency Bound: 0.0
• Upper Frequency Bound: 350.0
• History Interval: 2.5
• Trigger Threshold: 1.7
• Minimal Trigger Threshold: 0.4
• Output Pins: [5]
• Configuration Read Cyle: 5.0

Instance 'mids' of server type 'default'
• Lower Frequency Bound: 350.0
• Upper Frequency Bound: 4000.0
• History Interval: 2.0
• Trigger Threshold: 1.85
• Minimal Trigger Threshold: 0.5
• Output Pins: [6]
• Configuration Read Cyle: 5.0

Instance 'highs' of server type 'default'
• Lower Frequency Bound: 4000.0
• Upper Frequency Bound: 20000.0
• History Interval: 2.0
• Trigger Threshold: 1.75
• Minimal Trigger Threshold: 0.6
• Output Pins: [9]
• Configuration Read Cyle: 5.0
```

If we now play audio, the LEDs will light up in the way we wanted them to (especially when playing _Black Sands_).  

We can now save our current setup as a rack, so we can easily reuse it again:

```bash
lightshow live save black-sands
```

Next time we need this type of light show we can therefore just call:

```bash
lightshow start black-sands
```
