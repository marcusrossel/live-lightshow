# This file contains the URLs of all of the dependencies of this project.
# They are grouped by operating system. Within each operating system group, they are listed in the
# order:
# * Ardunio-CLI
# * Processing
# * Arduino Processing-Library
# * ddf's Minim Library

# This file acts as the configuration and reference document for the URLs of all project
# dependencies. It is used to determine where certain files should be downloaded from.
#
# Dependancy URLs are declared within "URL declarations". A URL declaration consists of a unique
# identifier, followed by one or more URLs, each on a new line. URL declarations must be seperated
# by empty lines. Furthermore, URL declarations are grouped by operating system.
