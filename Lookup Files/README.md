# Lookup Files

This directory contains all of the files used as reference for various kinds of information. They should be accessed by using the functions in _Utilities > lookup.sh_.

If any of the information needs to change, this is the central place to do so.

**`data-layout`** describes the format of the different data files used in the _Catalogue > Data_ directory.

**`dependency-urls`** contains the URLs of dependencies downloaded during installation.

**`file-paths`** contains path-strings to files inside and outside of the repository which need to be referenced consistently.

**`item-names`** contains constant string identifiers.

**`regular-expressions`** contains pattern-literals and formal grammar rules for creating patterns of regular-expressions. This mostly applies to those which are referenced multiple times in multiple scripts.

**`text-segments`** contains formatted segments of text, which would be too long to include inline in source code.
