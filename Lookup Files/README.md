# Lookup Files

This directory contains all of the files used as reference for various kinds of information. They
should be accessed by using the functions in _Utilities > lookup.sh_.

If any of the information needs to change, this is the central place to do so.

**`file-paths`** contains path-strings to files inside and outside of the repository which need to
be referenced consistently.

**`regular-expressions`** contains the pattern-literals of regular-expressions. This mostly applies
to those which are referenced multiple times in multiple scripts.

**`item-names`** contains constant string identifiers.

**`text-segments`** contains formatted segments of text, which would be too long to include inline
in source code.

**`dependency-urls`** contains the URLs of dependencies downloaded during installation.
