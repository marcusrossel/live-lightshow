# This file acts as the configuration and reference document for the layout of data files. It is
# used to determine what the order and therefore column number of certain attributes of specific
# data files is.
#
# Data files' layouts are declared within "layout declarations". A data file's layout declaration
# consists of a unique identifier, followed by the order of attributes given line by line. Layout
# declarations must be seperated by empty lines.
