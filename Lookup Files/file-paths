# This file acts as the configuration and reference document for particular file paths. It is used
# to determine where certain files are, or should be located.
#
# Files paths are declared within "path declarations". A path declaration consists of a unique
# identifier, followed by one or more file paths. Path declarations must be seperated by empty
# lines.
# Furthermore, path declarations can be placed in certain groups:
# * Repository-Relative: These paths are relative to the repository the file lives in.
# * Absolute: These paths are relative to the file system, and may use ~ for the home directory.
