# This file acts as the configuration and reference document for particular error messages. It is
# used to outsource long text segments from source code.
#
# Error messages are declared within "message declarations". A message declaration consists of a
# unique identifier, followed by the corresponding error message and ends with a line containing
# only the keyword "MESSAGE-END". Message declarations should be seperated by multiple empty lines
# for clarity.
#
# Line continuation is possible, by placing a \ at the very end of a line.
# Colorization can be achieved by using the predefined variables:
# RED>, YELLOW>, GREEN>, NORMAL>
