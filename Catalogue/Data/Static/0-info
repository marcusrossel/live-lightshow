The 'default' server is generic in its functionality.
It allows you to work with different types of frequencies and timing-values.

'Lower Frequency Bound' and 'Upper Frequency Bound' specify the frequency range on which the server
acts.
'Loudness Recalibration Duration' is given in seconds, and specifies for how long the server can not
have triggered before it resets its "recent maximum loudness", which is used to determine when to
trigger.
'Minimal Trigger Treshold' is a value between 0 and 1, declaring what the minimum loudness of a
chunk has to be - relative to the maximum loudness ever recorded by the server - in order to be able
to trigger.
'Output Pins' is an array of Arduino digital pin numbers, to which the server will send its output
as HIGH and LOW values.
