#!/bin/bash

# This script pulls a threshold-configuration from the `.ino`-file in the CLI-directory, lets the
# user configure it, and applies the changes to the `.ino`-file.
# If the user creates a malformed configuration, they are prompted to rewrite it or quit.
#
# Expectations:
# * there is exactly one file ending on ".ino" in the parent directory of this script
#
# Arguments:
# * <program directory> optional, for testing purposes
#
# Return status:
# 0: success
# 1: invalid number of command line arguments
# 2: internal error
# 3: the user chose to quit the program
