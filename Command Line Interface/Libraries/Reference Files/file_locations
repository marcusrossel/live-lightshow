# This file acts as the configuration and reference document for particular file paths. It can be
# used by CLI-scripts to determine where certain files are or should be located.
#
# Files paths are declared within "location declarations". A location declaration consists of a
# unique identifier, followed by one or more file paths, each on a new line. Location declarations
# must be seperated by empty lines.
# Furthermore, location declarations can be placed in certain groups:
# * CLI-Directory relative:
#   These paths are all relative to the Command Line Interface directory in the repository.
# * Program-Directory relative:
#   These paths are all relative to the Program directory in the repository.
# * Repository relative:
#   These paths are all relative to the repository in which the CLI-directory lives.
# * Absolute:
#   These paths are relative to the current file system and may contain a leading tilde.
# * URL:
#   These paths are all URLs, which therefore require a utility like curl or wget to access.
