# This file acts as the configuration and reference document for particular string constants. It
# can be used by CLI-scripts to enable consistent use of string constants.
#
# String constants are declared within "name declarations". A name declaration consists of a
# unique identifier, followed by the corresponding string. Name declarations must be seperated by
# empty lines.
